# About Us
Soothe, motivate, heal, and bring the change which music has the power to do it all!
Here at Vinyl Hills, we understand that and promote the way music hits right in the feels. 

We are a team of enthusiastic engineering students at San Jose State University. 
We decided to create Vinyl Hills to foster an environment where we can share our enthusiasm for vinyls and music.
